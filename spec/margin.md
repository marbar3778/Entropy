# Margin Accounts

Margin traders first open a specific margin account that they can deposit an underlying currency to be used as collateral. For the moment we will consider just a single currency but it is perfectly feasible to combine a bundle of currencies as collateral. Eventually, when the trader opens a position, buying a different currency on margin, they can choose a collateral ratio with which to fund the trade. A 50% collateral ratio (or 2x) is when half of the trade is financed from the traders equity and the other half from debt. Lending pools, which fund the debt, are characterized by a maximum collateral ratio (more is addressed in [governance](./governance.md)) and an interest rate (further addressed in [lending pools](./lending.md)). 

Let's roughly define some of these concepts.

```rust
pub struct MarginAccount {
    pub owner: Pubkey
    pub positions Vec<Position>
}

// This represents a single trade. The bought and sold is just a fractional representation of the price
pub struct Token {
    pub denomination: Denom
    pub value: u64
}

pub struct Loan {
    pub value: u64
    pub interest: u64 // this could be with respect to blocks or time
    pub height: u64 // the height that the loan was made (this is used to calculate the accrual of interest)
}

pub struct Position {
    pub trade: MarketTrade
    pub collateral: u64
    pub debt: Vec<Loans>
    pub base_denmination: Denom
    pub tokens: Vec<Token> // Note that the user could buy several tokens on margin
}
```

As we can see, a position represents a static snapshot of the time of the transaction. Naturally, this changes over the course of time as the value of the tokens in other denominations
changes with respect to the base denomination. Monitoring of the positions of each of the margin accounts in order to avoid a state where the collateral doesn't cover the loss is thus the responsibility of liquidity bots (see [liquidation](./liquidation.md)). 

A trader can have a set of simultaneous positions at once; each position corresponding to a different underlying denomination. At any point, the trader is able to perform a series of possible
actions (each action corresponding to a transaction): 

1. Close the position. This sells all the tokens at the market rate, repays the loan with interest and returns the remainder into a personal account.
2. Increase the collateral. This can be after the equivalent of a "margin call" is issued and the owner must increase his/her collateral to avoid entering the red zone (marked by the liquidation ratio (see [governance](./governance.md))
3. Buy more tokens. Expand the position by buying more tokens on margin.

## State

The contract has state. 

- Pairs: Pairs represents which trading pairs a margin account is allowed to trade. Serum is a large exchange with countless trading pairs. Many of these pairs do not have much liquidity. For this reason we need to limit which pairs are traded.

```rust 
#[state]
pub struct Margin {
    // pairs represents an array of pairs available to trade
    pub paris: vec<PubKey>,
}

Margin has a single account struct as state. 

```rust
#[account]
pub struct MarginAccount {
    /// The owner of this margin account.
    pub trader: Pubkey,
    /// Address of the account's token vault.
    pub vault: Pubkey,
    /// Signer nonce.
    pub nonce: u8,
    // TODO need to account for open trade state
}
```

## Messages

The margin contract defines 5 messages, four of which can only be accessed by the trader. 

### Initialize

Initialize creates a margin account on behalf of the caller.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init)]
    margin_account: ProgramAccount<'info, MarginAccount>,
    rent: Sysvar<'info, Rent>,
}
```

### Deposit

Deposit deposits funds into a program account to be used for trading. Once a trade is initiated, deposits can still be made. 

- Can only be called by the trader.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Deposit<'info> {
    // Depositor
    depositor: AccountInfo<'info>,
    // Authority (trader)
    #[account(signer)]
    depositor_authority: AccountInfo<'info>,
    #[account(mut)]
    vault: CpiAccount<'info, TokenAccount>,
    // Misc.
    #[account("token_program.key == &token::ID")]
    token_program: AccountInfo<'info>,
}
```

### Withdraw

Withdraw withdraws the funds from the account. Withdraw can only be called if there are no open trades. 

- Withdraw can only be called by the trader. 

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Withdraw<'info> {
    // Depositor
    depositor: AccountInfo<'info>,
    // Authority (trader)
    #[account(signer)]
    depositor_authority: AccountInfo<'info>,
    #[account(mut)]
    vault: CpiAccount<'info, TokenAccount>,
    // Misc.
    #[account("token_program.key == &token::ID")]
    token_program: AccountInfo<'info>,
}
```

### Trade

Trade does multiple things in a single step. When a user would like conduct a trade they will specify the amount of margin and total trade they would like to conduct. The program will check that there are enough funds in the margin account and check if there are enough funds in the lending pool. If there are enough funds the loan will be taken and the trade executed. At this point the margin account has been marked as having a open trade. At this point no withdraws can be made. When a user sells their position or part of the position the funds are repaid to the lending protocol, after this, what is left over is considered the amount the user has to withdraw. 

- Trade can only be called by the trader

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Trade<'info> {

}
```

### Liquidate

Liquidate is only performed when an account has hit their liquidation limit. This message tries to close the current position as fast as possible. It may need to place multiple trades based on liquidity of markets

- Liquidate can only be called by a coordinator. 

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Liquidate<'info> {

}
```



### Deleverage

Deleveraging is the act of lowering the amount of leverage. When a traders account hits threshold, defined by governance, a coordinator has the right to deleverage the account by another predefined percentage. 

- Deleverage can only be called by the coordinator.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Deleverage<'info> {

}
```

## Cross program interactions

The margin account contract makes a few cross program calls. To start the margin account has the right to take non-backed loans, and make trades on the Serum Dex. 

1. The first cross chain program interaction is in the creation of the margin account. When a margin account is created it needs to be registered within the lending protocol to enable non-backed loans. The

2. Secondly, when a leveraged trade is initiated, the margin account will make a request to the lending contract requesting funds to allow a leveraged trade. 
   1. When the user makes the trade the liquidation price, loan interest rate and fees are known already. The interest rate is fixed rate that is charged entirely, even if the trade is opened for a minute. 

3. Thirdly, when the margin account has taken the loan it will execute the trade against the serum dex.
