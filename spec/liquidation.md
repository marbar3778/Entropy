# Liquidation

Monitoring of margin account health is done through incentivised liquidation bots. These are expected to crawl through open margin positions and send `Liquidate` transactions to the network once a margin account drops below a liquidity threshold (see [Liquidate](./margin.md#Liquidate)).
