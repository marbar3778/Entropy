# Margin Trading: An Overview

 The high level run-down of margin trading is as follows: A trader wants to buy a commodity (whether it be a stock, currency or anything else of value). Let's take apples for example. The trader is motivated by a belief that the value of apples with respect to the currency she is holding will increase sometime in the near future. Let's say she currently holds 100 USD for simplicity's sake. Well, if you know something is going to increase in value with respect to something else (in this case apples per USD) then you will want to buy as much of it as possible. The more you buy before it goes up in value, the more profit you stand to make. Let's say the current price is $10USD/apple. The trader can only buy 10 apples. Thus she can only make $10 USD for every $1 that apples increase in value.

 Margin trading is where you leverage this initial capital, the $100 USD, as collateral to borrow a "marginal" amount to be able to buy even more apples. In this case if she could levarge half of her current equity, then instead of $100USD she would have $150 USD to buy 15 apples. Thus for every $1 increase in the price of apples, she is now earning a profit of $15 instead of $10. Let's explore the happy case a little further. Say the price doubles from $10USD/apple to $20USD/apple. She sells her 15 apples for $300 USD. She must return the $50USD she borrowed plus a small amount of interest. Thus she made a profit of $150 USD. This is apposed to the $100 she would have earned with the base case. Now, what happens if things go awry. Say the price drops by half to $5USD/apple. She now sells her 15 apples for a total of $75. She pays back the leveraged $50 and is left with 25 - a loss of 75. Without leveraging her capital she would have lost only $50. This simple example illustrates the role that this margin ratio provided. It is the added percentage to her profit/loss.

 There is one last catch that hasn't yet been covered. The trader that loaned the money doesn't want to be subject to the risk that the margin trader takes upon herself when buying apples. This is why margin trading requires equity to be staked as collateral. When the price of apples to USD drops below a certain threshold, the traders position is liquidated (or closed). The apples are sold and the remaining USD ($50) is returned to the trader that loaned the money. What is this threshold. Well we can just work backwards. The trader must pay back $50 from the 15 apples she has. This makes a price of 3.33 USD/apple. Usually it's a little higher to allow for slippage and interest. One last tiny point of interest. The amount being borrowed doesn't have to be less than the collateral. If the margin trader was really confident they could leverage 2x, 3x or 10x their collateral. In fact, it is most common to refer to the collateral ratio: the ratio between debt and collateral. If the margin trader borrowed 900USD for a total of 1000USD in apples. The price would only need to drop by a dollar for the trader to have to liquidate their position and be left with nothing.

Ok... enough of the simple stories, let's move on to the design.
